                <h2>Boston Shaker</h2>
                <p>is a two-piece device that is simple and effective. Typically there is one larger tin that is accompanied
                    by another smaller mixing vessel which can be made of glass or metal.While simple in design, the Boston
                    Shaker may take a bit of skill to use. Assembling this shaker must be done carefully to ensure that a
                    water tight seal is achieved or you’ll be wearing a cocktail. In addition separating the parts of the
                    Boston Shaker must also be done with care, especially when using a pint glass because it can be easily
                    broken.</p>

                <p>is a bartending tool used to portion liquor when making cocktails. Available in many an assortment of
                    sizes and styles, bar jiggers help bartenders prepare drinks quickly and consistently. While speed
                    probably isn’t a big requirement for home bartenders, consistency is important as you learn the
                    difference between an enjoyable cocktail and footwash, so it’s a good idea to prepare your drinks in a
                    consistent manner and a jigger measurement will help you do that.</p>

                <p>Simply put, a cocktail strainer is a bartending tool used to remove solid materials from the liquid in
                    the making of a drink. Also known as a bar strainer, the cocktail strainer is typically used after a
                    drink has been shaken or stirred to remove the ice, fruit or other solids that shouldn’t find their way
                    into the resulting cocktail.</p>

                        <p>This simple, lightweight, handheld tool comes in sizes that are perfect for pressing fresh lemon, lime,
                            or orange juice without losing a drop. Simply cut your fruit in half across the middle. Place the cut
                            side down into the half of the press that has holes. Flip the other half of the press over the fruit so
                            you can grasp both handles in one hand. Then squeeze down. No pith. No pips. Just fresh juice into your
                            mixing glass, ready and waiting for the addition of your other ingredients.</p>

                        <p>The Muddler is the oldest and most rudimentary of bartending tools and its necessity behind the bar is
                            not to be understated. The Muddler is used to extract flavours and aromas from delicate herbs and fresh
                            fruits, as well as to integrate granulated or cubed sugar into cocktails; all achieved through the
                            process of muddling. For such a simple tool there are a lot of variations of The Muddler out there on
                            the market. </p>

                        <p>Also referred to as "sugar syrup," simple syrup is a liquefied form of sugar that is commonly used to
                            sweeten cocktails, iced tea, iced coffee, lemonade, and other cold drinks. Because it is a liquid
                            sweetener, it is much easier to blend into cold beverages than regular sugar.</p>
