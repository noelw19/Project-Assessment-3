            <h2>Boston Shaker</h2>
            <p>is a two-piece device that is simple and effective. Typically there is one larger tin that is accompanied
                by another smaller mixing vessel which can be made of glass or metal.While simple in design, the Boston
                Shaker may take a bit of skill to use. Assembling this shaker must be done carefully to ensure that a
                water tight seal is achieved or you’ll be wearing a cocktail. In addition separating the parts of the
                Boston Shaker must also be done with care, especially when using a pint glass because it can be easily
                broken.</p>

            <h2>Jigger</h2>
            <p>is a bartending tool used to portion liquor when making cocktails. Available in many an assortment of
                sizes and styles, bar jiggers help bartenders prepare drinks quickly and consistently. While speed
                probably isn’t a big requirement for home bartenders, consistency is important as you learn the
                difference between an enjoyable cocktail and footwash, so it’s a good idea to prepare your drinks in a
                consistent manner and a jigger measurement will help you do that.</p>

            <h2>Hawthorne Strainer</h2>
            <p>Simply put, a cocktail strainer is a bartending tool used to remove solid materials from the liquid in
                the making of a drink. Also known as a bar strainer, the cocktail strainer is typically used after a
                drink has been shaken or stirred to remove the ice, fruit or other solids that shouldn’t find their way
                into the resulting cocktail.</p>

            <h2>Mexican Elbow</h2>
            <p>This simple, lightweight, handheld tool comes in sizes that are perfect for pressing fresh lemon, lime,
                or orange juice without losing a drop. Simply cut your fruit in half across the middle. Place the cut
                side down into the half of the press that has holes. Flip the other half of the press over the fruit so
                you can grasp both handles in one hand. Then squeeze down. No pith. No pips. Just fresh juice into your
                mixing glass, ready and waiting for the addition of your other ingredients.</p>

            <h2>Muddler</h2>
            <p>The Muddler is the oldest and most rudimentary of bartending tools and its necessity behind the bar is
                not to be understated. The Muddler is used to extract flavours and aromas from delicate herbs and fresh
                fruits, as well as to integrate granulated or cubed sugar into cocktails; all achieved through the
                process of muddling. For such a simple tool there are a lot of variations of The Muddler out there on
                the market. </p>

            <h2>Simple Syrup</h2>
            <p>Also referred to as "sugar syrup," simple syrup is a liquefied form of sugar that is commonly used to
                sweeten cocktails, iced tea, iced coffee, lemonade, and other cold drinks. Because it is a liquid
                sweetener, it is much easier to blend into cold beverages than regular sugar.</p>
            <p>Recipe: equal parts sugar and hot/warm water, simmer and stir till disolved.</p>
