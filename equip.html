                <h2>Boston Shaker</h2>
                <p>is a two-piece device that is simple and effective. Typically there is one larger tin that is accompanied
                    by another smaller mixing vessel which can be made of glass or metal.While simple in design, the Boston
                    Shaker may take a bit of skill to use. Assembling this shaker must be done carefully to ensure that a
                    water tight seal is achieved or you’ll be wearing a cocktail. In addition separating the parts of the
                    Boston Shaker must also be done with care, especially when using a pint glass because it can be easily
                    broken.</p>

                    probably isn’t a big requirement for home bartenders, consistency is important as you learn the
                    difference between an enjoyable cocktail and footwash, so it’s a good idea to prepare your drinks in a
                    consistent manner and a jigger measurement will help you do that.</p>
