            <p>is a two-piece device that is simple and effective. Typically there is one larger tin that is accompanied
                by another smaller mixing vessel which can be made of glass or metal.While simple in design, the Boston
                Shaker may take a bit of skill to use. Assembling this shaker must be done carefully to ensure that a
                water tight seal is achieved or you’ll be wearing a cocktail. In addition separating the parts of the
                Boston Shaker must also be done with care, especially when using a pint glass because it can be easily
                broken.</p>

            <p>is a bartending tool used to portion liquor when making cocktails. Available in many an assortment of
                sizes and styles, bar jiggers help bartenders prepare drinks quickly and consistently. While speed
                probably isn’t a big requirement for home bartenders, consistency is important as you learn the
                difference between an enjoyable cocktail and footwash, so it’s a good idea to prepare your drinks in a
                consistent manner and a jigger measurement will help you do that.</p>

                    lime,
                    or orange juice without losing a drop. Simply cut your fruit in half across the middle. Place the
                    cut
                    side down into the half of the press that has holes. Flip the other half of the press over the fruit
                    so
                    you can grasp both handles in one hand. Then squeeze down. No pith. No pips. Just fresh juice into
